Biology => Full-Stack Web Developer

I am a San Jose State University and more recently an App Academy graduate. At App Academy, I completed their full-stack web development program. In this boot camp, I improved my knowledge of javascript, python, and other packages useful for creating a polished, user-friendly web application. At San Jose State I received a BS in biology with a concentration in systems physiology and a minor in chemistry. Although I am passionate about physiological sciences, in my senior year I began learning Python. After getting my degree, I ultimately decided to change paths and focus on coding instead. I loved the challenges and problem-solving within coding and decided to commit to becoming a software developer. My curiosity and passion for learning and problem-solving led to some of my other interests and hobbies being automobile engineering and rock climbing.
